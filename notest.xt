"Quarkus is a stack to develop distributed systems and modern applications in Java, Kotlin, or Scala. Quarkus applications are tailored for the Cloud, containers, and Kubernetes. That does not mean you canâ€™t use Quarkus in other environments, there are no limits, but the principles infused in Quarkus have made containerization of applications more efficient. "

"In this workshop, you will develop an application that allows superheroes to fight against supervillains. You will be developing several microservices communicating either synchronously via REST or asynchronously using Kafka"
